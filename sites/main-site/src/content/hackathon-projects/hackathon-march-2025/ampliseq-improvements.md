This project aims to enhance the [nf-core/ampliseq](https://nf-co.re/ampliseq/dev) pipeline to support plant metabarcoding analyses. By expanding the reference database, we will improve its functionality, fostering broader adoption and making plant metabarcoding more accessible to the scientific community.

## Goals
- Expanding the reference sequences for plant metabarcoding analyses.
- Integrating the new references following the latest nf-core and Nextflow standards.  
- Benchmarking and validating the pipeline to ensure error-free performance.  
- Improving documentation and user support to promote broader adoption.

  *We welcome contributors of all experience levels.*
