This project will focus on improving and optimizing the [nf-core/bacass](https://nf-co.re/bacass/dev) pipeline. This is a great opportunity to address open issues, enhance performance, and conduct benchmarking and testing.

We encourage both experienced Nextflow developers and newcomers to join!

## Goal

1. Address and resolve existing issues in the `nf-core/bacass` pipeline.
2. Conduct benchmarking and testing to improve pipeline robustness and efficiency.
3. Enhance documentation and usability of the pipeline.
