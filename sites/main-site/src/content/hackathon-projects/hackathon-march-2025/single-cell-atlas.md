The Single-cell Expression Atlas analysis workflow runs downstream analyses using Scanpy, leveraging the [scanpy-scripts](https://github.com/ebi-gene-expression-group/scanpy-scripts) package to run individual steps of the Scanpy workflow.

See [Single Cell Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc)
and [current Nextflow workflow](https://github.com/ebi-gene-expression-group/scxa-tertiary-workflow).

## Goal

Adapting the Single-Cell Expression Atlas Analysis Workflow to meet `nf-core` standards.
