## How to proceed

As there is a lot of modules (i.e. 162) and subworkflows (i.e. 23) to migrate we need to stay organise to avoid duplicated work. To do so, we created a [project list](https://hackmd.io/bZ1dM18_TMqLPxFxg1NjGQ) and a simple procedure as follow:

- Check if no one is already assigned to the modules/subworkflow you want to work on.
- Add your github username to the hackmd
- Perform the migration
- When your pull request is ready, ask for a review and add the PR number to the hackmd
- When merged add the date to the hackmd
- Rinse and repeat !
