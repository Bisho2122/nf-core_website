This project aims to build upon and update the [nf-core/lncpipe](https://github.com/nf-core/lncpipe) pipeline, originally designed for the analysis of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). 
While development has slowed down, we aim to modernize the pipeline and bring it to the current nf-core and Nextflow pipeline standards, improve its usability, and demonstrate its relevance for the scientific community.

We welcome contributors of all experience levels.

## Goal

1. Update the pipeline to the latest nf-core and Nextflow standards.
2. Expand documentation and user support to encourage wider adoption.
3. Improve compatibility with current reference genome annotations and transcriptomic datasets.
4. Optimize integration with existing RNA-seq pipelines for seamless lncRNA analysis.

Join us in improving lncpipe and making lncRNA analysis more accessible!
