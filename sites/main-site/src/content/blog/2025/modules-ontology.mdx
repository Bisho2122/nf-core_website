## Introduction

Nf-core modules come with a `meta.yml` file used to describe the structure of that module.

The initial structure of the `meta.yml` file did not represent the structure of the modules input and output channels.
This structure was describing all channel elements at the top level, without grouping them by channel.
This led to issues such as missing descriptions for multiple meta maps or difficulties in the identification of different channels.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
    ```groovy title="main.nf"
    inputs: tuple val(meta), path(fasta)
    ```
    </div>
    <div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
        ```yml title="meta.yml"
        - meta:
            type: map
            description: |
            Groovy Map containing sample information e.g. [ id:'test', single_end:false ]
        - assembly:
            type: file
            description: |
            FASTA, GenBank or EMBL formatted file pattern: "*.{(fa, fasta, fna, fa.gz, fasta.gz, fna.gz, gbk, gbk.gz, embl, embl.gz)}"

        ```
    </div>

</div>

Back in october 2024 we [updated all nf-core modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules/pull/6674) to make sure that all of them specify the proper input and output channel structures.

We also introduced linting checks to nf-core/tools to ensure the proper structure of `meta.yml` files.

Together with this linting checks, we also introduced a new flag to the `nf-core modules lint` command, `--fix`.
This flag will try to fix all the possible lint failures related to the `meta.yml` file by updating it.
